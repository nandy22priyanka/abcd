## DETERMINATION OF COVID 19 EPICENTER NEAR YOU


# INTRODUCTION

Today the whole world is affected by the pandemic Covid 19. It is a contagious disease which can easily be spread through the droplets produced by the infected person during coughing or sneezing. Because of this pandemic many countries are under lockdown today, it is unsafe to go to most of the places today. Keeping these problems in consideration we tried to develop a GUI that can tell you how safe is the place you are going to visit.


# HOW THE PROJECT WORKS

1. At first download a zip file of our project from our github repository.
2. Then extract the files from the zip file.
3. Then open the **Project.py** file it will lead you to our GUI.
4. Then enter the state you are going to visit and click **submit** to see the number of covid 19 cases and it is under which zone(red,orange or green).
